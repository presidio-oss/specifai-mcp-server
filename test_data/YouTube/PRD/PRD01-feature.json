The function should accept video ID and a list of tags as input, update the video metadata with the provided tags, and store the updated metadata in the designated GCP storage or database. Ensure validations for maximum number of tags and disallow duplicate tags.  \n#### Acceptance Criteria:  \n- The function receives video ID and a list of tags as input.  \n- The function updates the video metadata with the provided tags in GCP storage/database.  \n- Prevent duplicate tags for the same video.  \n- Add validation for a maximum number of tags per video (e.g., 10).  \n- Return appropriate error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., video ID not found, invalid tag format).  \n- Verify updated metadata is stored securely in GCP.",
